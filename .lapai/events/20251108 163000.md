# Prompt

create a github workflow that syncs the content of [obsidian-plugin](https://github.com/lgazo/event-modeling-tools/tree/main/packages/obsidian-plugin) package content into the root of this repository whenever triggered. By default it should take the version on `main` branch but keep it parametrized. The workflow will be manual.
